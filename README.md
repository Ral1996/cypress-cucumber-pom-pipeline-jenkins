# What is cypress cucumber?

Cucumber is widely used tool which supports and helps in Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

Cypress provides integration with Cucumber for writing the test scenarios in BDD format. Cypress uses all the capabilities of Cucumber by using the Cucumber-preprocessor node module. It explains test steps and allows us to write tests in simple English using the Gherkin language.  I hope we are already aware of what is BDD. 

# Project Structure

- Fixtures: It stores all the test data information. Usually, the data is stored in JSON format.
- Integration: We can write all the test files in this folder.
- Plugins: This folder includes index.js file. We can write custom methods to handle cypress events.
- Support: It store utility methods or reusable functions commonly used by all the tests.
- Videos/screenshots: stores evidence during test run.
- json : main configuration file. We can override different default settings for cypress here. It saves different cypress related configurations for e.g. base URL, - timeouts, etc.
